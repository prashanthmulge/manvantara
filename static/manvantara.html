	<p>Hello Friends, </br></br>
We are forming this group as a small step towards our bigger dreams.
We are getting into busy schedule of the life day by day. Earlier we were searching for the reason to get together but now its like vice versa.
Even though we are there in different path of life either in different companies or colleges or groups or  organisations, we need a common forum to come up and all work together. As a solution for this our <span style="color:blue">”MANVANTARA”</span> came into picture.
People say about the “joy of sharing” which can’t be comparable to any other.</br></br> Everyone might had this moment in small scale, individually or in many forms in earlier days But this is the time where we can experience the same feeling all together with this common forum. Because Happiness is the only feeling which will increase as much as we share.
So guys, together we will join our hands, together we will plan and prepare, together we will move into this journey and at the end of the day we can enjoy together. We can get a sweet sleep end of the everyday if we are in the right way in this path. We also feels that we are doing something good to not only to improve ourselves but also to improve our society, which intern feels us more responsible for a good cause, for building a better country.
Please express your ideas in this forum. We are open to all kind of suggestions because its all yours and you have full rights to build this forum.</br></br>
We have to make this small seed of dream into a big tree with fruits and shelter to many……</br></br></p>
